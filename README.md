# robosoccer
There was a robo-soccer match in our area for which me and my partner Pradip Prasad Nuire designed and made a three wheeler macro car to play soccer. 
We used the Audrino-Uno.
We had 2 motor for rear big rear wheels, a free wheel and bluetooth module for the mobile to behave as remote for the car.
